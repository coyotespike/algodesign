If we can implement Depth First Search iteratively, we win.

If we can consider how DFS plays with my data structure and how to begin
building Kosaraju's algorithm on top of DFS, we double win and get pizza.


Kosaraju's algorithm figures out which portions of a network are strongly connected.
Strongly Connected Components are clusters of nodes which know each other, but not others. 
You can get in, but you can't get out. Creepy.

Kosaraju's Algorithm has three steps.
    First, it takes a directed graph, runs DFS on it, and records the nodes' finish order.
    Second, it reverses the direction of the graph: incoming connections are outgoing, and vice versa.
    Third, it runs DFS on the graph using the "magic order." The new finish order tells us the leaders of the SCCs. 
       By counting how many nodes have the same leader, we know how many members are in each SCC.

If you follow a node to find its neighbor, the first node is the leader. 

My implementation below can be improved in many ways, but first of all, it exceeds my Mac's hard thread limit. 
Also it was slow. 

If we build the algorithm on an iterative implementation of DFS instead of recursive,
I think it will work better. 

(we could also try Stackless Python or decorators. I don't know decorators yet though) 


procedure DFS-iterative(G,v):
      let S be an empty stack
      S.push(v)
      while S is not empty
            v ‚Üê S.pop() 
            if v is not labeled as discovered:
                label v as discovered
                for each unvisited neighbor w of v
                    S.push(w)
